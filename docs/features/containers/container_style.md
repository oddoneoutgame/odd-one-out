# Container Style

The container styles could be divided into 2 categories:

* [FEDSA Container Styles](../fedsa_container_styles)

* [Local Container Styles](../local_container_styles)

## FEDSA Container Styles

This category represents the container styles that are being returned from the Content API.
These container styles are a 1-on-1 mapping with the values listed in the the [FEDSA Documentation](https://github.bamtech.co/pages/fed-solutions/documentation/content/collections-sets.html#set-container-style).

## Local Container Styles

This category represents the container styles that are hardcoded locally.

Each style in this category has been added to allow having a style configuration for a page that isn't built based on a collection.

!!! example
    Each tab on the detail page has its own hardcoded container style to support different UI per tab.
