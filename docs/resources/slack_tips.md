# Slack Tips

This doc provides valuable information regarding slack usage

## Etiquette

- All slack messages are saved forever. This is a legal requirement for the company
    - Because of this, it can be useful to search slack for old messages or threads
- Slack messages can only be edited for a very short period of time after sending the message. Edit it quick if you need to!
- Please be careful with using `@here` or `@channel` in a big channel. If used inappropriately, you may be swarmed with the `:slackpolice:` emoji
- If you have several messages to send regarding a specific topic, it is common to use a `:thread:` emoji and then add your additional messages in the thread. This
 just helps keep channels clean / organized
- [Here is a small guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/202288908-Format-your-messages) on how to format text if you've never used slack before
