# RipCut

* RipCut is our near real-time image processing service that reduces costs and overhead
* We use a combination of RipCut and [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide) to load our images - see `RipcutGlideImageLoader.kt` for implementation details
* RipCut helps us add badging (Disney+ Original) and scrims dynamically - [more details here](https://github.bamtech.co/pages/fed-solutions/documentation/content/images.html#schema)
* We have a handful of RipCut related configurations - see `RipcutConfig.kt`
* [More details about the RipCut API here](https://github.bamtech.co/pages/fed-solutions/documentation/content/images.html#ripcut-apis)
