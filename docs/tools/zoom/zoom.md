# Zoom

We use Zoom for meetings - here are a handful of tips

## Automatically mute when joining a meeting

- **Zoom** → **Preferences** → **Audio** → scroll down → Check the box **Mute my mic when joining a meeting**

## Blur / Image Backgorund

- **Zoom** → **Preferences** → **Background & Effects** → select **Blur** or another fun background image

## Turn on Outlook Zoom plugin

- This is incredibly useful when creating Zoom meetings
- In Outlook, click **New Event**
- In the top right of this New Event there should be an option to add the Zoom plugin
- Once added, you can click this **Zoom** plugin and it will automagically add a Zoom meeting to the body of your event

## Turn off Zoom ding when someone joins / leaves meeting

- **Zoom** → **Preferences** → **General** → scroll down → select **View More Settings** → Web settings open, select **In Meeting (Basic)** → Uncheck the box **Sound notification when someone joins or leaves**

## Remove Window resize on screen share

- When someone else shares their screen in a meeting, Zoom automatically goes full screen. This turns that off
- **Zoom** → **Preferences** → **Share Screen** → under **Window size when screen sharing:** select **Maintain current size**
