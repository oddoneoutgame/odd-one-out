# Remote Overlay

This is a functionality to see the key pressed events in order to facilitate video recording of bugs on TV and facilitate showing the relevant interactions.

!!! tip "Enable Remote Control Overlay"
This functionality can be found in Jarvis, enabling the toggle on `Overlays/ Show Remote Control Overlay on TV`.

???+ example "Remote Control Layer Enabled"
![](../../tools/images/remote.gif)

Once that is ON, the user can see an overlay showing all the key pressed, there are icons showing the major navigation keys, but when another key is pressed
It will be shown on a label.
This can be more useful whenever there are bugs on TV and a video can clarify the repro steps but we would like to know all the key inputs that happened on that userâ€™s journey,
So while this can be useful for developers this can also be useful for the QA teams.
