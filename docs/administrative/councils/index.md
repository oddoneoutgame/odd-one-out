# Disney Streaming Android Councils

Disney Streaming Android Councils are a set of councils that consist of Android team members that are responsible for creating and maintaining standards and processes in their respective domain areas. The goal of the councils is to provide a mechanism for feedback, as well as allow for a small, controlled group to make decisions that are acted on by the entire team.

## Councils

There are three Councils that we operate:

* Hiring Council
* Onboarding Council
* Tech Council

## Council Expectations

Each individual council has unique expectations that you can find on their respective pages. Below, you can find the set of expectations that apply to all of them:

* Dedicate approximately 2-3 hours per week to responsibilities.
* Attend regularly scheduled meetings. Work with members of the council to determine meeting times. This includes planning meetings as well as office hours.
* Work with TPMâ€™s to prioritize work on Dmgz while maintaining responsibilities for the council.

## Joining a Council

Unfortunately, council space is limited as each council has up to 6 members. This is intentional in order to keep the groups small and focused. If you would like to join a council, reach out to your manager and let them know of your interest. When a spot opens up, we will assign new members to the councils based on who is interested.

In order to facilitate more involvement, each council will hold regularly scheduled Office Hour sessions. These will be 30-60 minute sessions that are open to the entire team where feedback and input from non-council members can be addressed.
