## Goals

Defining high level goals for the Hiring Council to agree on will help align us when making decisions

* **Empathy for the Candidate** - Prioritizing empathy for the candidate is a a great way to make sure each candidate is having a positive experience
* **Consistency** - Interviews can be a bit dynamic based on the skills of the candidate, and who is conducting the interview. To ensure each candidate have similar rates of success in our interview process, valuing some consistency is important
* **Evaluating Skills** - Attempting to accurately evaluate the skills of a candidate is a top priority. Techincal skills, soft skills, cultural fit, etc.
* **Empathy for the Interviewer** - Having a cumbersome hiring proces is a great way to increase interviewer burnout. It will also make it more difficult to have team members want to conduct interviews, or even spark a desire to get involved
* Keeping the experience of the interviewer in mind is beneficial to us
