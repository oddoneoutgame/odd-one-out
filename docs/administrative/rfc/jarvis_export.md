# JARVIS EXPORT

## Why?

- Clicking through the many portions of Jarvis is tedious. Devs do it, QA does it, etc. If you need to switch apps, environments, Delorean, add configs, and choose a vision-config, that takes more time then it should and is also prone to error

## What?

- Create a Jarvis feature where we can export the exact settings setup. Similar to Charles or Android Studio

## How?

- We create an `export` / `import` settings button on Jarvis
- All applicable Jarvis values are stored in one place that can be exported, like a `.json` file? Something else?

## Impact

- A ton of people, devs, QA, etc.
